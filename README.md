Numerous ecological, environmental, and climatic variables affect the health of honeybee colonies. Therefore, the location of beehives is essential for lowering honeybee mortality and, consequently, preventing colony losses. Using multiple machine learning (ML) models is one method to decide where beehives should be placed in various ecological, environmental, and climatic circumstances. Taking into account the aforementioned factors in the ML models first requires gathering data and then preprocessing them. The purpose of this code is to organize the meteorological data into the proper order and store them in Excel files so that they can be imported into the ArcGIS software for the interpolation procedure.
